    This test method is not annotated with a QuickPerf annotation. However, it will

    defined in org.quickperf.QuickPerfConfiguration class.

    You can use @FunctionalIteration or @DisableQuickPerf to disable QuickPerf
    features and focus on functional behavior (not performance behavior) in a first
    step. In a second step, you can remove @FunctionalIteration or @DisableQuickPerf
    to evaluate some performance properties. We recommend to do one step at a time.
