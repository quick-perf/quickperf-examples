    /* FIRST TYPE OF N+1 SELECT

    We expect to retrieve all the players from the database with one SELECT statement.
    This is verified with the help of an @ExpectSelect(1) QuickPerf annotation added on
    test method.

    Let's execute this test method. This test is failing!

    In the bottom of the error report, the SQL executions are displayed. We have one
    SELECT statement on Player table, and two more on Team table. For each player a
    SELECT statement is executed to retrieve his team. We have a N+1 select issue as
    suggested by the error report: "Perhaps you are facing a N+1 select issue".

    The error report proposes several ways of fixing an N+1 SELECT.

    In this case, in the Player entity, let's specify a lazy fetch type for the
    relationship between the players and their team:
          @ManyToOne(targetEntity = Team.class, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
          @JoinColumn(name = "team_id")
          private Team team;

    If you run the test with this modification, it will be green!

            assertThat(players).hasSize(2);

    }

    // In the previous example, the outcome of the N+1 select was to have additional
    // SELECT statements on Team table. These additional SELECT statements are the
    // same
    // apart from the id value of the Team table.
    //
    // With QuickPerf, you can easily detect that the same SELECT statements with
    // different
    // values are executed, allowing to catch N+1 selects. We are going to see this
    // in the
    // next example.

    /*
     * SECOND TYPE OF N+1 SELECT
     * 
     * This test method is not annotated with a QuickPerf annotation. However, it
     * will fail because a N+1 select is detected from a global annotation defined
     * in org.quickperf.QuickPerfConfiguration class:
     * disableSameSelectTypesWithDifferentParams Global apply on each test method.
     * 
     * This comes from the following Java code: List<PlayerWithTeamName>
     * playersWithTeamName = players .stream() .map(player -> new
     * PlayerWithTeamName( player.getFirstName() , player.getLastName() ,
     * player.getTeam().getName() ) ) .collect(Collectors.toList());
     * 
     * Each time the getName() method is called, a SELECT... FROM Team statement is
     * sent to the database.
     * 
     * This type of N+1 SELECT can't be solved by configuring a LAZY fetch type.
     * 
     * To fix this N+1 SELECT, you can use JOIN FETCH or a LEFT JOIN FETCH:
     * TypedQuery<Player> fromPlayer =
     * entityManager.createQuery("FROM Player p LEFT JOIN FETCH p.team",
     * Player.class);TypedQuery<Player> fromPlayer
     * 
     * These solutions are suggested by the QuickPerf error report.
     * 
     * Global annotations apply on each test. In the case where you are developing a
     * new feature, perhaps with the help of TDD, your test may fail because the
     * business property is un-respected but also because some performance
     * properties checked by global annotations are un-respected. In order to do one
     * step at a time, you can temporarily disable global annotations by
     * applying @FunctionalIteration or @DisableQuickPerf
     * or @DisableGlobalAnnotations at method level.
