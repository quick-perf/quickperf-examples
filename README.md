# quickperf-examples

This repository contains example of how to integrate Quickperf with some popular frameworks.

It contains the following example applications:

- [micronaut-hibernate-jpa-example](micronaut-hibernate-jpa-example]): Micronaut Hibernate JPA with JUnit5 test using both QuickPerf JVM and SQL annotations. 
- [quarkus-example](quarkus-example): Quarkus with JUnit5 test using only SQL annotations (JVM annotations didn't work yet for Quarkus).
